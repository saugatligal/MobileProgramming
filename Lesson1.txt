My first class in mobile programming:
Well, my first class in mobile programming went really well.Professor Crater was very friendly and he explained initial part of
mobile programming really well.
In my first class, i got overview about two important things.Thats is android apps development IDE (android studio)and development
of my first app and deploying my android tablet.In class, i learnt about android version such gingerbread,jellybeans,kitkat and there
version number.I also got idea that nowadays android studio is the main ide for android apps development.Professor gave us simple over
view about android stuidio ide . It installation process and what can we do using android studio.I learn to develop my first app
using android studio.
Another thing which i learnt from this class is to get good material from different website such developer.android.com  and many other
website which is useful for us in mobiles app development.
And the most important part of our first class to under the android apps lifecycle.I learnt all the cycle of android apps where it
goes and where it stops when we use our apps.I learnt about whole project folder and about its file. Most importantly androidmanifest
file which keeps all the details of the android apps.
So, my first class in mobile was just brilliant.I am lookin forward to learnt more things in coming period.
